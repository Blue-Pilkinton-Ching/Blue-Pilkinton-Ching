### Kia ora, I'm Blue!ðŸ‘‹

Since the age of ten or eleven, I have been programming. I started with scratch, the visual block-based programming language, and since then have gone to develop games and web apps, both independently and in groups of teams. I love to learn, and get a kick out of building interactive and practical products.

I am a highly motivated and enuthusiastic person. I have a strong love for learning, and enjoy a challenge. I am fascinated by technology, and enjoy engaging with new and popular tech, as it comes out. I'm looking to get a programming job having completed bootcamp, so flick me an email if your hiring!

Feel free to check out any of my stuff!

Recently, I completed a full stack web development bootcamp at Dev Academy Aotearoa, which finished in December 2023. Many of my repos are challenges that I completed during this bootcamp period. 

At the moment, I'm working on a [https://github.com/Blue-Pilkinton-Ching/ChatGPT-Website](web app) for interfacing with various Open AI GPT models. 

Cheers!
