### Kia ora, I'm Blue!ðŸ‘‹

At a young age, I started programming with Scratch, the visual block-based programming language. Since then have gone to develop games and web apps, both independently and in teams. I love to learn, and get a kick out of building interactive and practical products. 

Recently, I completed a full stack web development bootcamp at Dev Academy Aotearoa. This course has given me a much deeper understanding of software development and working with others using agile methodologies. 

Alongside the development of technical skills, this course has a very strong emphasis on Human Skills. Iâ€™m all for it! I have a strong value for kindness, empathy, and communication. Any place I work at, or situation Iâ€™m in, I strive for inclusivity and diversity.

Having completed an Animation course at Yoobee Colleges, I have learnt alot about design, 3d modeling, animating, and rendering and have been able to apply that to the games and projects I have worked on as well. 

I am a highly motivated and enthusiastic person. I have a strong love for learning, and love to get my gears wiring with a challenge. I am fascinated by technology, and enjoy engaging with new and popular tech, as it comes out (particularly AI!). I'm looking to get into the software dev industry, so definitely flick me an email if your hiring, or otherwise check out my portfolio.

Many of my repos are challenges that I completed during my bootcamp period. For my more sophisticated and developed repos, check the pinned options below.
