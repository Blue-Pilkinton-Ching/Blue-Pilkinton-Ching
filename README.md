### Kia ora! ðŸ‘‹

Since the age of ten or eleven, I have been programming. I started with scratch, the visual block-based programming language, and since then have gone to develop games and web apps, both independently and in groups of teams. I love to learn, and get a kick out of building interactive and practical products. 

Recently, I started a full stack web development bootcamp at Dev Academy Aotearoa, which is set to finish in December 2023. This course has given me a much deeper understanding of programming & workflow outside of game engines. Dev Academy has taught me: 

- Package management
- External api requests
- Server-client relationship
- Databases
- React
- Express
- Nodejs 
- Authentication
- Typescript.

Some of the games I have made have involved:

- Multiplayer Networking (Unity NGO)
- Multiplayer Matchmaking (Unity Lobby)
- Online voice chat (Vivox)
- Unity VFX & Shader Graph
- Compute Shaders
- 3d & 2d games
- Multithreaded code
- C# debugging & breakpoints

Having completed an Animation course at Yoobee Colleges, I have learnt alot about design, 3d modeling, animating, and rendering and have been able to apply that to the games and projects I have worked on as well. 

I am a highly motivated and enuthusiastic person. I have a strong love for learning, and enjoy a challenge. I am fascinated by technology, and enjoy engaging with new and popular tech, as it comes out. I'm looking to get a programming job having completed bootcamp, so definitely flick me an email if your hiring!
